# Python-Timesheet
This is just a self project that I wanted to do using Pandas library, and learn more about using python and excel together. This was a way for me to get my foot into
"database" with python. This code is creates a small gui with three buttons, for clocking in, clocking out, and opening the timesheet. Still have to tweak some things
out though.
