# Python-Timesheet
This is just a self project that I wanted to do using Pandas library, and learn more about using python and excel together. This was a way for me to get my foot into
"database" with python. This code is creates a small gui with three buttons, for clocking in, clocking out, and opening the timesheet. Still have to tweak some things
out though.

If you want to have this as an executable (.exe) file, package it with pyinstaller. I couldn't upload the .exe file because it was 31.4mb  and the maximum on github is 25mb.
